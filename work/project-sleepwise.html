      <div class="position-name-text-2">MOTIVATION</div>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">Have you ever found yourself scrolling through your phone before bed, struggling to fall asleep? If so, you are not alone. We were motivated by the fact that unregulated in-bed smartphone use could resonate with almost everyone. A reasonable amount of screen time enables us to get work done efficiently, whereas unregulated use of electronic devices can disrupt sleep patterns and negatively influence both mental and physical health. We all want to <strong>cultivate healthy smartphone and sleeping habits</strong> as college students, but it&#x27;s easier said than done.</div>

      <div class="position-name-text-2">METHOD &amp; FINDINGS</div>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">Following the <strong>HCD framework</strong>, we conducted <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong>, <strong>diary studies</strong>, and a <strong>co-design workshop</strong> to inform our final design. These methods allowed us to investigate different questions at various stages of the research and design process, with each question&#x27;s focus building sequentially on insights obtained from the preceding method.<br> </div>
      <h3 class="heading-57">Diary Studies</h3>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">We conducted <strong>a one-week diary study</strong> involving Cornell students to gain deep insights into their smartphone usage before bedtime. Through a combination of <strong>feedback</strong> and <strong>elicitation</strong> diaries, participants self-evaluated their pre-bed smartphone behaviors, offering real-time insights impossible to obtain from surveys. We engaged eight students who used smartphones extensively before sleep. Participants documented anticipated usage, activities, and submitted Google Forms with morning reflections and screenshots of their entries. </div>

      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">Data analysis unveiled patterns like social media&#x27;s time-consuming allure, impacting sleep latency. The study highlighted preferences for activities with endpoints and the challenge of managing stimulating games. Some found comfort in pre-sleep calls, while interventions varied in effectiveness. Notably, locking phones aided one participant, fostering a consistent sleep schedule. Early obligations were found to advance sleep timings. </div>

      <h3 class="heading-57">Co-Design Workshop</h3>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">We conducted a co-design workshop to enhance the pre-bed experience in a more personalized manner. Our approach involved recruiting four participants from earlier contextual interviews and diary studies, ensuring diverse perspectives. The goal was to maintain balanced input by selecting individuals with varied pre-bed routines. We re-engaged the same participants to establish trust and rapport, facilitating valuable feedback for refining the final design.</div>

      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">We presented our printed guiding prototypes to familiarize participants with the potential scope of our final design and encouraged them to critique and develop new ideas by drawing and annotating on the prototypes. </div>

      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">The co-design workshop produced various types of data, including field notes, sketches, photos, record clips, and design ideas. To systematically analyze the data, the audio recordings were transcribed and the field notes were reviewed across participants to identify common themes and patterns. By comparing both results and complementing each other, the insights were used to guide the design decisions and ensure that the design was tailored to the users&#x27; needs, enabling refinement of the design iteratively based on user feedback. </div>

      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">Our design aims to improve sleep quality and duration by addressing the insights gathered from user research. We have designed SleepWise, a social and gamification app that aims to motivate users to develop healthy sleep patterns. </div>
      <h3 class="heading-57">Onboarding</h3>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">During the onboarding process, the application gives users the option to select the method that works best for them to provide personalized onboarding. Based on our findings that morning obligations could combine well with social motivation and that gamification only works well with a specific group of people, we incorporated both as our primary features to give users a sense of control over their experience. </div>

      <h3 class="heading-57">Challenges</h3>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">The design provides users with challenges related to healthy bedtime habits, such as limiting app usage time, and practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques. Users can select the challenges that are most relevant to their goals and track their progress over time. The goal-setting theory suggests that setting specific, challenging, and achievable goals leads to better performance and motivation. </div>

      <h3 class="heading-57">Social Connections</h3>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">Recognizing the importance of social connections, the app includes features that facilitate social interaction before bed, such as setting morning obligations with friends to achieve, and sharing progress with a supportive community. Social support is also a crucial factor in behavior change. Users are more motivated to complete an obligation with someone familiar, and our app provides a friend list and chat feature to help users connect with friends and support each other finishing the challenge collectively. </div>

      <h3 class="heading-57">Gamification</h3>
      <div class="paragraph-light-3 cc-position-name">Gamification is a powerful tool to motivate users to change their behavior and develop healthy habits. To make pre-bed routines more engaging, the app includes game-like features such as goal-setting, rewards, and progress tracking. Users can earn badges and points for completing activities and compete with friends to stay motivated. By providing immediate feedback, users are more likely to achieve their sleep goals. </div>
